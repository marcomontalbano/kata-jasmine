Test driven development
=======================

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:

* first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function.
* then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test.
* finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

JavaScript TDD with Jasmine
===========================

Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.

It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

Katas
=====

A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.

The term was probably first coined by [Dave Thomas][], co-author of the book [The Pragmatic Programmer][], in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts.

As of October 2011, Dave Thomas has published [21 different katas][].

Setup
=====

There are two ways to execute tests.

Output on HTML
--------------

Install [Node.js][Node.js] and then execute:

```sh
node webserver.js
```

Open you favorite browser and link to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

Output on Console
-----------------

Grunt and Grunt plugins are installed and managed via npm, the [Node.js][Node.js] package manager.

In order to get started, you'll want to install Grunt's command line interface (CLI) globally.

You may need to use sudo (for OSX, \*nix, BSD etc) or run your command shell as Administrator (for Windows) to do this.

```sh
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt jasmine
```


Continuous Integration with drone.io
------------------------------------

[drone.io][drone.io] is a continuous integration for GitHub and Bitbucket that monitors your code for bugs.

In order to use drone.io with your JavaScript projects you must use output on console instead of the html.

1. Create a `New Project`.
1. Select the Repository.
1. Select `Node.js` as language.
1. Fill the `Build Script` field with the following script:

```sh
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt jasmine
```

That's it!
