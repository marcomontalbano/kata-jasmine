Test driven development
=======================

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle:

* first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function.
* then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test.
* finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

Javascript TDD with Jasmine
===========================

Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.

It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

Katas
=====

A code kata is an exercise in programming which helps a programmer hone their skills through practice and repetition.

The term was probably first coined by [Dave Thomas][], co-author of the book [The Pragmatic Programmer][], in a bow to the Japanese concept of kata in the martial arts.

As of October 2011, Dave Thomas has published [21 different katas][].
